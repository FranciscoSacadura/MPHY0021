=================================================

Research goals:
+ Role of proprioceptive feedback to cerebellum (via ECN) during reaching
+ Monosynaptic inputs to ECN

Techniques:
+ Electrophysiology
+ Optogenetics
+ Viral (rabies) tracing
+ Histology
+ Tissue clearing
+ Light-sheet imaging

Preliminary results:
+ ECN perturbations have minor effects on online motor control
+ Over time, reach success and kinematics degraded
+ Suggests ECN inputs may play role in updating internal model of limb
