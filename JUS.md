============================================

Research goals:
    - Role of proprioceptive feedback to cerebellum (via ECN) during reaching
    - Monosynaptic inputs to ECN
    - Role of efference copy to cerebellum (via BPN) during reaching
    - Role of frontal cortex during two-position reaching
    - Role of IT and PT neurons in motor cortex during reaching

Techniques:
    - Electrophysiology
    - Optogenetics
    - Viral (rabies) tracing
    - Histology
    - Tissue clearing
    - Light-sheet imaging

Preliminary results:
    - ECN perturbations have minor effects on online motor control
    - Over time, reach success and kinematics degraded
    - Suggests ECN inputs may play role in updating internal model of limb
