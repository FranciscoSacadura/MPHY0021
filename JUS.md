    - Role of proprioceptive feedback to cerebellum (via ECN) during reaching
    - Monosynaptic inputs to ECN
    - Role of efference copy to cerebellum (via BPN) during reaching
    - Role of frontal cortex during two-position reaching
    - Role of IT and PT neurons in motor cortex during reaching
